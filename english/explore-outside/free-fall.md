Have you ever tried free-fall?

How would you feel when you would be free-falling from a tall tower like Burj Khalifa or from Eiffel Tower?

Have u ever thought of it? I guess, yes, in our dreams, most of us in our dreams we dream many things which we have already done or the desire for the things which we haven't done.

One e.g. I can give you like free-falling is bungeejumping
Doing bungeejumping is like you got the feeling like u have reached at the topmost part of the world. It's very fun.

But it's prohibited for those who has fear of vertigo

But if you want to go for real free-fall then do it at ur own risk.......
And before going out for free-fall please left a note behind that whatever may or maynot be happen to me only I will be responsible for this no one else....

If u still can't change ur mind then 
[have a look at this video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQFMy9Tz8dY)

Still not, then I think u have enjoyed ur life to the fullest
